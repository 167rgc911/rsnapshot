INSTALLATION
	
	IF YOU ARE UPGRADING FROM A PREVIOUS INSTALLATION:

		su
		make install
		
	IF YOU ARE INSTALLING FOR THE FIRST TIME (and just want the defaults):

		cp /usr/local/etc/rsnapshot.conf.default /usr/local/etc/rsnapshot.conf
		# Modify /usr/local/etc/rsnapshot.conf to suit your system.
		
	Please note that rsnapshot now uses GNU autoconf for the installation
	procedure. You can use the following options to configure for more control
	over where various parts of rsnapshot are installed. The example values
	shown also happen to be the defaults.
		
		--prefix=/usr/local
			This will install everything under /usr/local
			
		--sysconfdir=/usr/local/etc
			This will install the example config file under /usr/local/etc.
			It is recommended that you copy this and use it as a basis for
			the actual config file.
