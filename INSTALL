UPGRADING
	If you are upgrading from version 0.9.1, please note that the
	format of /etc/rsnapshot.conf has changed. Tabs are now the
	required delimiters instead of spaces, and all directory entries
	require a trailing slash. See /etc/rsnapshot.conf.default for
	a syntactically valid example.
	
	If you are upgrading from 0.9.4 or later, please note that
    several commands are now deprecated. Please see README for more
    information.
