INSTALLATION

    IF YOU ARE UPGRADING FROM A PREVIOUS INSTALLATION:

        ./configure --sysconfdir=/etc
        su
        make install

        Also, make sure and see the README file or the ChangeLog for
        some minor but important differences between the 1.0 and 1.1
        releases.

    IF YOU ARE INSTALLING FOR THE FIRST TIME (and just want the defaults):

        ./configure
        su
        make install
        cp /usr/local/etc/rsnapshot.conf.default /usr/local/etc/rsnapshot.conf
        # Modify /usr/local/etc/rsnapshot.conf to suit your system.

    IF YOU REQUIRE MORE PRECISE CONTROL:

        You can pass the following options to ./configure for more control
        over where various parts of rsnapshot are installed. The example
        values shown also happen to be the defaults.

            --prefix=/usr/local
                This will install everything under /usr/local

            --sysconfdir=/usr/local/etc
                This will install the example config file
                (rsnapshot.conf.default) under /usr/local/etc. It is
                recommended that you copy this and use it as a basis for
                the actual config file (rsnapshot.conf).

            --bindir=/usr/local/bin
                This will install the rsnapshot program under /usr/local/bin

            --mandir=/usr/local/man
                This will install the man page under /usr/local/man

            --with-perl=/usr/bin/perl
                Specify your preferred path to perl. If you don't specify
                this, the build process will detect the first version of perl
                it finds in your path.

            --with-rsync=/usr/bin/rsync
                Specify your preferred path to rsync. If you don't specify
                this, the build process will detect the first version of rsync
                it finds in your path. You can always change this later by
                editing the config file (rsnapshot.conf).

            --with-cp=/bin/cp
                Specify the path to GNU cp. The traditional UNIX cp command
                is not sufficient. If you don't specify this, the build process
                will detect the first version of cp it finds in your path.
                If you don't have the GNU version of cp, leave this commented
                out in the config file (rsnapshot.conf).

            --with-rm=/bin/rm
                Specify the path to the rm command. If you don't specify this,
                the build process will detect the first version of rm it finds
                in your path.

            --with-ssh=/usr/bin/ssh
                Specify your preferred path to ssh. If you don't specify this,
                the build process will detect the first version of ssh it
                finds in your path. SSH is an optional feature, so it is OK if
                it isn't on your system. Either way, if you want to use ssh,
                you need to specifically enable this feature by uncommenting
                the "cmd_ssh" parameter in the config file (rsnapshot.conf).

            --with-logger=/usr/bin/logger
                Specify your preferred path to logger. If you don't specify
                this, the build process will detect the first version of
                logger it finds in your path. If you want syslog support,
                make sure this is enabled in the config file. Syslog support
                is optional, so if you don't have it or comment it out it's OK.

CONFIGURATION
    Edit /etc/rsnapshot.conf to suit your tastes. The exact location of this
