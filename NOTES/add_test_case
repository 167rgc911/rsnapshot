These are some notes on how to add a new test case (XYZ) into rsnapshot.
The contents of the test script are not covered here (yet).


vi t/XYZ.t.in
# Create test script

vi t/support/etc/XYZ.conf.in
# Create rsnapshot.conf for test (if required)

cvs add t/XYZ.t.in t/support/etc/XYZ.conf.in

vi configure.ac
# Add
>> AC_CONFIG_FILES(t/support/etc/XYZ.conf:t/support/etc/XYZ.conf.in)
# and
>> AC_CONFIG_FILES(t/XYZ.t:t/XYZ.t.in)

./configure
# To generate t/XYZ.t from t/XYZ.t.in etc

make test
# Verify that test works as expected - if not use vi and make test.

cvs commit t/XYZ.t.in t/support/etc/XYZ.conf.in configure.ac
# These files were directly updated

cvs commit configure Makefile.in
# These files would have been regenerated
