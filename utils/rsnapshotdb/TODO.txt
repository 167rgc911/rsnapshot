TODO LIST:

1/22/06 - Thoroughly test rewrite using ssh keys and tunneling.

Optimize code efficiency, main reason I'm throwing this out on the web as GPL :-)

Thoroughly test with postgresql, mysql on Linux only so far.

Decide whether to stop, or continue on errors/connectivity issues. Possibly throw an email/SMS at someone. Problem because assumption is that you're db's are being archived without error.

Test in various scenarios: -p optional, postgresql, etc.

Bypass the need to store database passwords locally in rsnapshotDB.conf if user is network authenticated.
