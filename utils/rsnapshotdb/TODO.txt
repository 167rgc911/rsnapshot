TODO LIST:

- as suggested by r00t in #bash, split on tables instead of db.
- enable split | gzip to get in under isp radar (cpu resource limits with I/O on large db's).
- thoroughly test with postgresql, mysql on Linux only so far. thanks to <poo> in #bash

1/22/06
- DONE - Thoroughly test rewrite using ssh keys and tunneling.
- DONE - Optimize code efficiency, main reason I'm throwing this out on the web as GPL :-)

Decide whether to stop, or continue on errors/connectivity issues. Possibly throw an email/SMS at someone. Problem because assumption is that you're db's are being archived without error.

- DONE - Bypass the need to store database passwords locally in rsnapshotDB.conf if user is network authenticated.
