TODO LIST:

Optimize code efficiency, main reason I'm throwing this out on the web as GPL :-)

is 'wait;' necessary? This came about in restricted CPU usage environment, I think it can be stripped.

Thoroughly test with postgresql, mysql on Linux only so far.

Error verbosity handling/trigger

Decide whether to stop, or continue on errors/connectivity issues. Possibly throw an email/SMS at someone. Problem because assumption is that you're db's are being archived without error.

Work out the remoteWhichBin vs. localWhichBin for optimum compatability

Move Dumper hash to an xml file? Naahhh....

remotely 'echo -n 'SHOW DATABASES;' | mysql -s -u username -h db.server.com -p'

Test in various scenarios: -p optional, postgresql, etc.

Bypass the need to store database passwords locally in rsnapshotDB.conf if user is network authenticated.

rename to rsnapshotDB and pull out deprecated code.
