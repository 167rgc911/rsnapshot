rsnapshotDB has a few necessary requirements pre-install, as follows

Pre-install Requirements:

1) Perl v. 5.8.7+

2) Net::SSH::Perl

When installing as root, type: "$ cpan", then at prompt: "cpan> install Net::SSH::Perl".

I choose the defaults, and when asked, installed "Crypt::RSA", which I believe is necessary for RSA public/private keys used with ssh-keygen ('man ssh-keygen' for more info).

Don't sweat it, there are lots of dependencies, after I got RSA, I just said "[yes]" to all. If you have a diskspace issue, you probably don't want to backup your data here anyway.

3) Unix commands: scp, rm, gzip, mysqldump/pg_dump, nice

These need to be inplace on both the remote and/or local server. If using XML conf, then definitely on both servers for scp, rm, gzip, and 'nice'.

The "dumper" programs can be only on the remote server since rsnapshotDB version: 1.2.

Nice-to-Haves:

1) ssh-keygen public key on remote server

Ideally, you would automate easily by having public/private ssh keys on your servers, but if not, Net::SSH::Perl is supposed to use the password given in the rsnapshotDB.conf xml file. See ~/.ssh and 'man ssh-keygen'.

2) local access to database server

This would also negate the need of storing vital (ie - "password") info in the XML config file.

Note: This hasn't been thoroughly tested yet!

3) Copy rsnapshotDB.conf.sample to /etc/rsnapshotDB.conf


Note: Even without root, you should be able to install Net::SSH::Perl locally in your home directory. see:--PREFIX, etc. arguments when installing

cpan> prompt may even have a way of doing this for you.
