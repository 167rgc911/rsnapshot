The scripts in this folder are quick and dirty examples of things that you may
or may not find useful in conjunction with rsnapshot.

rsnaptar
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    A script that can automatically tar up your latest snapshots and send you
    an e-mail when it's done. You may need to edit some of the variables by
    hand.

backup_pgsql.sh
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    An example script to backup a PostgreSQL database, to be invoked from
    rsnapshot using the "backup_script" parameter. You will probably need to
    modify this for your setup.

backup_rsnapshot_cvsroot.sh
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    An example script to backup the CVS repository for the rsnapshot project,
    which is hosted on SourceForge. This script is a good example of using
    the wget program to archive web content in your backups. This script is
    designed to be invoked from rsnapshot using the "backup_script" parameter.
