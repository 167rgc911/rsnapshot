The scripts in this folder are mostly quick and dirty examples of things that
you may or may not find useful in conjunction with rsnapshot.

rsnapshot-diff
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Shows differences between two similar directories under the snapshot root.
    Can also be called using the "rsnapshot diff interval1 interval2" syntax.
    This is the only program under utils/ that gets installed by default.

rsnaptar
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    A script that can automatically tar up your latest snapshots and send you
    an e-mail when it's done. You may need to edit some of the variables by
    hand.

backup_dpkg.sh
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    An example script to backup package info on a Debian system, to be invoked
    from rsnapshot using the "backup_script" parameter. If you have a Debian
    system, this will most likely work without changes.

backup_mysql.sh
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    An example script to backup a MySQL database, to be invoked from rsnapshot
    using the "backup_script" parameter. You will probably need to modify this
    for your setup.

backup_pgsql.sh
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    An example script to backup a PostgreSQL database, to be invoked from
    rsnapshot using the "backup_script" parameter. You will probably need to
    modify this for your setup.

backup_rsnapshot_cvsroot.sh
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    An example script to backup the CVS repository for the rsnapshot project,
    which is hosted on SourceForge. This script is a good example of using
    the wget program to archive web content in your backups. This script is
    designed to be invoked from rsnapshot using the "backup_script" parameter.

backup_smb_share.sh
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    An example script to backup a Microsoft SMB share, to be invoked from
    rsnapshot using the "backup_script" parameter. This requires the Samba
    program. You will definitely need to modify this for your system.

debug_moving_files.sh
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Debug script for rsync. Moves files around, so you can try backing them
    up to see what rsnapshot does. Only useful if you're having problems
    with vanishing files and want to have a known source of them.

make_cvs_snapshot.sh
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Quick and dirty shell script to find/replace "real" version numbers with
    a CVS-date version.

rsnapshot_if_mounted.sh
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Deprecated. A work-around for using removable drives as the snapshot
    root. Superceded by the "no_create_root" option in rsnapshot proper.

sign_packages.sh
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The shell script used to automate package signing for releases.
