- Conditionalized the backup_interval() and rotate_interval() subroutines to
  only delete the oldest interval if we're keeping more than one of that
  interval

VERSION 1.0.5 (Nov 14 00:22 2003)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Changed domain to rsnapshot.org
- Added lockfile feature, with patch to enable it by default in the RPM
- Updated man page to include the one_fs feature, did general clean up
- Fixed '..' pattern matching bug that would exclude valid files

- Fixed anonymous rsync feature, which had been broken in 1.0.3

VERSION 1.0.3 (Nov 2 14:43 2003)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Carl Wilhelm Soderstrom <chrome@real-time.com> added RPM format to release.
- Added "one filesystem" option to prevent rsnapshot from crossing filesystems
  within a backup point. Patch provided by Ted Zlatanov <tzz@lifelogs.com>
- Minor typographical errors fixed.

VERSION 1.0.2 (Oct 24 23:22 2003)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- added -V "extra verbose" option, to show rsync verbose output

VERSION 1.0.1 (Oct 18 03:22 2003)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Make sure the snapshot directory either needs to be created or already is a
  directory. Previously we were checking only if the snapshot root existed,
  which would cause problems if it were a file.
- Cleaned up and streamlined the config file parsing portion of the code.
- Changed numeric comparisons so that a typo would prevent compilation,
  instead of acting weird. i.e. (0 == $foo) instead of ($foo == 0)

VERSION 1.0.0 (Sep 14 02:58 2003)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Removed backward compatibility cruft for mkdir, touch, rm, and mv.
- rsnapshot has now been tested successfully on Debian and Redhat Linux, as well
  as IRIX and Solaris.
- Man pages are no longer gzipped, for compatibility with Solaris and others.

VERSION 0.9.5 (Sep 9 20:11 2003)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Removed most dependencies on external shell programs.
- Added compatibility for non-Linux platforms.
- Did significant testing/debugging to ensure compatibility with perl 5.004,
  5.6, and 5.8
- Tested and working successfully on IRIX, more tests to follow.

VERSION 0.9.4 (Sep 1 23:55 2003)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Heavily commented variables, and added much stricter syntax checking of the
  config file.
- Additional error checking on mkdir
- updated the man page.

VERSION 0.9.3 (Sep 1 01:46 2003)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Anonymous rsync connections now supported.
- Reverted back from recycling the oldest snapshots to the tried and true
  method of deleting the old ones.
- Now rsnapshot will not only create the snapshot root directory as it did
  before, but it will also chmod 0700 the directory when it creates it.

VERSION 0.9.2 (Aug 31 04:08 2003)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Optimized rotating snapshot intervals by recycling the last directory to the
  first, instead of deleting the last and copying .0 to .1
- Added support for spaces in path names.
- The config file now requires tabs to seperate all entries, where spaces were
  before acceptable. This was the easiest way to support spaces in path names.
- Directory entries now require a trailing slash. This is so that files can be
  treated correctly without having to be examined directly (which is
  impractical over rsync/ssh).
