Description: Local and remote filesystem snapshot utility
             .
             rsnapshot is a filesystem snapshot utility
             It can take incremental snapshots of local
             and remote filesystems for any number of
             machines. rsnapshot makes extensive use of
             hard links, so disk space is only used when
             absolutely necessary.
