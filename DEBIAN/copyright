This is a Debian package of the rsnapshot utility.

This package provides the rsnapshot program, which is a filesystem
snapshot utility based on rsync.

This package was put together by Nathan Rosenquist
<nathan@rsnapshot.org>, from sources obtained from:
  http://www.rsnapshot.org/downloads/rsnapshot-1.1.5.tar.gz

The changes were very minimal - merely adding support for the Debian
package maintenance scheme, by adding various debian/* files, and
changing the location files are installed to conform to Debian Policy.
Also, there is a "utils" directory in the original source tree that
is installed under /usr/share/doc/rsnapshot/utils/. It simply contains
some ad-hoc shell scripts that can be customized to be useful with
rsnapshot. Since they are installed in the doc/ hierarchy, they are
chmod 644 when installed.
