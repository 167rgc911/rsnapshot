rsnapshot TODO list:

for version 1.1.x
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Add e-mail reporting patch from David Tejedor.

- Add rollback feature for link_dest

- Add interactive mode to generate config files.

- Add rsync STDOUT/STDERR output to logfile at higher log settings. This will
  be accomplished by opening the rsync command as a pipe to a filehandle and
  printing / logging the output.

- Is it possible to have 'mv hourly.N  hourly.tmp' as the first step and
  then, once the rsync is completed successfully, a call can go out to delete
  hourly.tmp, even backgrounding the process? At present, if the job fails
  at the rsync stage, the oldest hourly is already gone, and rollback is not
  possible.

- Figure out a good solution to this: when an rsync transfer fails, and
  link_dest is being used, the smallest interval files are still moved up
  one. This requires a full transfer next time. What's the cleanest way to
  handle this?

- Figure out a way to do transfers the other way: from clients to the server
  instead of just from the server to the clients. Of course it will have to
  be very secure. Ideally we could support chroot environments for the
  connecting clients. This will probably result in a "backup_sync" parameter,
  as well as a designated root directory to allow clients to rsync into, that
  will then be synced into the main snapshots. This sync directory will need
  to be on the same filesystem as the actual snapshots, to allow hard links.

- Think of a way to be able to backup different backup points at different
  speeds. I.E. some things would get backed up hourly, whereas other backup
  points would get backed up daily.
