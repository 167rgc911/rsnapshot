rsnapshot TODO list:

for version 1.0.x
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Handle platforms other than Linux and GNU. cp -al seems to be the crux of
this incompatibility, since the -al flags do not exist on BSD, and I
believe Solaris as well. Probably any non-GNU system will have this issue.
I believe the best replacement will be native Perl functions:
	
	mkdir -p  -> File::Path -> mkpath('foo/bar', 0, 0755);
	touch     -> utime(time(), time(), 'foo');
	cp -al    -> custom subroutine: link(), stat(), etc. (recursive)
	mv        -> File::Copy -> move('old', 'new');
	rm -rf    -> File::Path -> rmtree('foo', 0, 1);
	
	rsync and ssh should continue to be handled by external commands, since
	we want to avoid non-standard Perl modules at all costs.
	
	cmd_{mkdir,touch,cp,mv,rm} entries in /etc/rsnapshot.conf should cause
	warnings to be displayed, but still allow the program to run.
	
for version 1.1.x
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Handle additional protocols, using a web style prefix
(i.e. http://path/to/http/server). rsync is already included. http, ftp,
cvs, and more would be nice. Make sure that if the file downloaded is the
same as the one yesterday, that it will link today's file to yesterdays.
It seems unavoidable to waste bandwidth with a non rsync system, but at
least we can prevent the wasting of disk space.
