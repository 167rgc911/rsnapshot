rsnapshot TODO list:

for version 1.0.x
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Get config file parsing with autoconf working 100% and fully integrated

- Update string manipulations and comparisons of paths to use File::Spec and
  File::Basename functions where possible. Double check they're fully
  compatible with Perl 5.004

- Add an file exclusion list feature, using "include" and "exclude" params
  in the config file. These will be passed directly as args to rsync.

- Add support for rsh using this syntax: rsh://[user@]domain:/foo/bar/

- Also support ssh:// syntax in the same fashion

- Add support for arbitrary programs to handle certain types of connections;
  i.e. http_handler could be set to wget, to handle http downloads, which are
  then rsynced into main snapshot_root tree

- Support for SSH tunnelling (this may work with the ssh_args param(?))

- Add syslog support. Make sure it's compatible with Perl 5.004 cross platform.
  Sys::Syslog is installed but doesn't seem to work on Perl 5.005 / Solaris 8.

- Add a command-line argument to force the removal of the lockfile.

for version 2.0.x
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Possibly rewrite it in C, if there's time or inclination. This would be a
  lot of work! However, it would allow all the benefits of GNU cp combined
  with total compatibility.
