rsnapshot TODO list:

for version 1.0.x
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Keep track of whether we hit any non-fatal errors during the run, then
  report at the end whether the run was successful.

- Add logfile and loglevel parameters to config file.

- Figure out a way to do transfers the other way: from clients to the server
  instead of just from the server to the clients. Of course it will have to
  be very secure.

- Update string manipulations and comparisons of paths to use File::Spec and
  File::Basename functions where possible. Double check they're fully
  compatible with Perl 5.004

for version 2.0.x
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Possibly rewrite it in C, if there's time or inclination. This would be a
  lot of work! However, it would allow all the benefits of GNU cp combined
  with total compatibility.
