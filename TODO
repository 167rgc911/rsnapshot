rsnapshot TODO list:

for version 1.0.x
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Add documentation for rsync_short_args and rsync_long_args

- Get package set up with the autoconf build system

- Update string manipulations and comparisons of paths to use File::Spec and
  File::Basename functions where possible. Double check they're fully
  compatible with Perl 5.004

- Add an file exclusion list feature

- Implement a generalized way to pass arbitrary args to ssh

- Add support for rsh using this syntax: rsh://[user@]domain:/foo/bar/

- Also support ssh:// syntax in the same fashion

- Add support for arbitrary programs to handle certain types of connections;
  i.e. http_handler gets set to wget, to handle http downloads, which are
  then rsynced into main snapshot_root tree

- Support for SSH tunnelling

for version 2.0.x
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Possibly rewrite it in C, if there's time or inclination. This would be a
  lot of work! However, it would allow all the benefits of GNU cp combined
  with total compatibility.
