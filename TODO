TODO:
	
update the Makefile to use variables, ideally by calling
./rsnapshot version_only for the app version number
	
come up with an elegant way to handle additional protocols,
probably using a web style prefix (i.e. http://path/to/http/server)

decide on what to do about the slash issue with rsync/ssh. currently
rsnapshot.conf only supports directories as sources (since it adds
a trailing slash to every entry). will having the slash at the end
make this too confusing and error prone?
