rsnapshot TODO list:

for version 1.0.x
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Test 0.9.x versions thoroughly on as many obscure UNIX platforms as possible.
Remove deprecated cruft before final 1.0 release.

for version 2.0.x
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Possibly rewrite it in C, if there's time or inclination. This would allow
all the benefits of GNU cp combined with total compatibility.
