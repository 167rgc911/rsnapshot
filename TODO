rsnapshot TODO list:

for version 1.0.x
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+ Add lock file to prevent a second cron task from running
  before the first one stops (don't forget to trap for signals)
+ Add an file exclusion list feature
+ Implement a generalized way to pass arbitrary args to rsync and ssh
+ Support for SSH tunnelling (this may be handled by arbitrary args)

for version 2.0.x
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+ Possibly rewrite it in C, if there's time or inclination. This would be a
  lot of work! However, it would allow all the benefits of GNU cp combined
  with total compatibility.
