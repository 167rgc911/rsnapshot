rsnapshot TODO list:

for version 1.0.x
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Update string manipulations and comparisons of paths to use File::Spec and
  File::Basename functions where possible. Double check they're fully
  compatible with Perl 5.004

- Add an file exclusion list feature, using "include" and "exclude" params
  in the config file. These will be passed directly as args to rsync.

- Add syslog support. Make sure it's compatible with Perl 5.004 cross platform.
  Sys::Syslog is installed but doesn't seem to work on Perl 5.005 / Solaris 8.

for version 2.0.x
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Possibly rewrite it in C, if there's time or inclination. This would be a
  lot of work! However, it would allow all the benefits of GNU cp combined
  with total compatibility.
