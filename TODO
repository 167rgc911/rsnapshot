rsnapshot TODO list:

for version 1.0.x
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Add documentation for rsync_short_args and rsync_long_args

- Tie up loose ends with the autoconf build system
  - $sysconfdir/rsnapshot.conf should only be installed if it doesn't exist,
    if at all. There should be zero chance that the users config will ever
    be overwritten.
  - $sysconfdir/rsnapshot.conf.default should be installed on "make install"
  - It would be nice to parse rsnapshot during ./configure to set the default
    config file based on the --sysconfdir value
  - Test install process on Debian, Redhat, Fedora, Solaris, Mac OS X, *BSD,
    and maybe IRIX if it's convenient

- Update string manipulations and comparisons of paths to use File::Spec and
  File::Basename functions where possible. Double check they're fully
  compatible with Perl 5.004

- Add an file exclusion list feature, using "include" and "exclude" params
  in the config file. These will be passed directly as args to rsync.

- Document ssh_args option

- Add support for rsh using this syntax: rsh://[user@]domain:/foo/bar/

- Also support ssh:// syntax in the same fashion

- Add support for arbitrary programs to handle certain types of connections;
  i.e. http_handler could be set to wget, to handle http downloads, which are
  then rsynced into main snapshot_root tree

- Support for SSH tunnelling

- Add syslog support. Make sure it's compatible with Perl 5.004 cross platform.

for version 2.0.x
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Possibly rewrite it in C, if there's time or inclination. This would be a
  lot of work! However, it would allow all the benefits of GNU cp combined
  with total compatibility.
