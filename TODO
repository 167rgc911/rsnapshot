rsnapshot TODO list:

for version 1.0.x
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Get package set up with the autoconf build system

- Update string manipulations and comparisons of paths to use File::Spec and
  File::Basename functions where possible. Double check they're fully
  compatible with Perl 5.004

- Put rsync and all arguments to it in an array, then join it to create
  the command. Then:
  - Add an file exclusion list feature
  - Implement a generalized way to pass arbitrary args to rsync and ssh
  - Add support for rsh using this syntax: rsh://[user@]domain:/foo/bar/
  - Also support ssh:// syntax in the same fashion
  - Add support for connecting to an rsync daemon requiring authentication,
    either using the --password-file flag or RSYNC_PASSWORD env var
  - Add support for arbitrary programs to handle certain types of connections;
    i.e. http_handler gets set to wget, to handle http downloads, which are
    then rsynced into main snapshot_root tree

- Support for SSH tunnelling (this may be handled by arbitrary args)

for version 2.0.x
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Possibly rewrite it in C, if there's time or inclination. This would be a
  lot of work! However, it would allow all the benefits of GNU cp combined
  with total compatibility.
