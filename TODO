rsnapshot TODO list:

for version 1.0.x
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Test autoconf install process on Redhat, Fedora, Solaris, Mac OS X, *BSD,
  and maybe IRIX if it's convenient

- Possibly get autoconf to detect rsync, ssh, and the GNU version of CP and
  write a file based on this information. This may or may not be practical.

- Update string manipulations and comparisons of paths to use File::Spec and
  File::Basename functions where possible. Double check they're fully
  compatible with Perl 5.004

- Add an file exclusion list feature, using "include" and "exclude" params
  in the config file. These will be passed directly as args to rsync.

- Add support for rsh using this syntax: rsh://[user@]domain:/foo/bar/

- Also support ssh:// syntax in the same fashion

- Add support for arbitrary programs to handle certain types of connections;
  i.e. http_handler could be set to wget, to handle http downloads, which are
  then rsynced into main snapshot_root tree

- Support for SSH tunnelling (this may work with the ssh_args param(?))

- Add syslog support. Make sure it's compatible with Perl 5.004 cross platform.

for version 2.0.x
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Possibly rewrite it in C, if there's time or inclination. This would be a
  lot of work! However, it would allow all the benefits of GNU cp combined
  with total compatibility.
