rsnapshot TODO list:

for version 1.0.x
---------------------------------------
Handle platforms other than Linux and GNU. Specifically, cp -al seems to be
unique to the GNU fileutils package, and thus not compatible with BSD, etc.
Probably the best thing to do would be to use Perl's built in functions
(link(), unlink()) to handle this with a recursive subroutine or two.

for version 1.1.x
---------------------------------------
Handle additional protocols, using a web style prefix
(i.e. http://path/to/http/server). rsync is already included. http, ftp,
cvs, and more would be nice. Make sure that if the file downloaded is the
same as the one yesterday, that it will link today's file to yesterdays.
It seems unavoidable to waste bandwidth with a non rsync system, but at
least we can prevent the wasting of disk space.
