rsnapshot TODO list:

for version 1.0.x
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Remove checks before calling print_* subroutines, just call them and let
  the routines decide whether to print or log

- Keep track of whether we hit any non-fatal errors during the run, then
  report at the end whether the run was successful.

- Add include, exclude, include_file, and exclude_file parameters, which
  will simply pass their contents directly to rsync invocations.

- Do COMPREHENSIVE test before next release

- Figure out a way to do transfers the other way: from clients to the server
  instead of just from the server to the clients. Of course it will have to
  be very secure. Ideally we could support chroot environments for the
  connecting clients. This will probably result in a "backup_sync" parameter,
  as well as a designated root directory to allow clients to rsync into, that
  will then be synced into the main snapshots.

- Update string manipulations and comparisons of paths to use File::Spec and
  File::Basename functions where possible. Double check they're fully
  compatible with Perl 5.004

for version 2.0.x
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Possibly rewrite it in C, if there's time or inclination. This would be a
  lot of work! However, it would allow all the benefits of GNU cp combined
  with total compatibility.
