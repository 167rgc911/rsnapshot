rsnapshot TODO list:

for version 1.1.x
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Add GPG backup feature to rsnaptar

- Figure out a good solution to this: when an rsync transfer fails, and
  link_dest is being used, the smallest interval files are still moved up
  one. This requires a full transfer next time. What's the cleanest way to
  handle this?

- Figure out a way to do transfers the other way: from clients to the server
  instead of just from the server to the clients. Of course it will have to
  be very secure. Ideally we could support chroot environments for the
  connecting clients. This will probably result in a "backup_sync" parameter,
  as well as a designated root directory to allow clients to rsync into, that
  will then be synced into the main snapshots. This sync directory will need
  to be on the same filesystem as the actual snapshots, to allow hard links.

- Update string manipulations and comparisons of paths to use File::Spec and
  File::Basename functions where possible. Double check they're fully
  compatible with Perl 5.004

for version 2.0.x
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Possibly rewrite it in C, if there's time or inclination. This would be a
  lot of work! However, it would allow all the benefits of GNU cp combined
  with total compatibility.
