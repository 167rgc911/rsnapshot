rsnapshot TODO list:

for version 1.0.x
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Handle platforms other than Linux and GNU. cp -al seems to be the crux of
this incompatibility, since the -al flags do not exist on BSD or Solaris.
Probably any non-GNU system will have this issue. I believe the best
replacement will be native Perl functions, with the option to use GNU cp
if it is available. What follows is a mapping of the old to the new:
	
	mkdir -p  -> File::Path -> mkpath('foo/bar', 0, 0755);
	touch     -> utime(time(), time(), 'foo');
	cp -al    -> still use it, or a custom subroutine (default)
	mv        -> rename('old', 'new');
	rm -rf    -> File::Path -> rmtree('foo', 0, 1);
	
	rsync and ssh should continue to be handled by external commands, since
	we want to avoid non-standard Perl modules at all costs.
	
	cmd_{mkdir,touch,mv,rm} entries in /etc/rsnapshot.conf should cause
	warnings to be displayed, but still allow the program to run. They
	will be removed in the final stable version of this branch.
	
	If cmd_cp is set, it will imply GNU cp. If it is not specified, or
	if it fails, we will fall back to the native Perl implementation,
	with the only drawback being the handling of special files (/dev
	entries, fifo, etc).
	
for version 2.0.x
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Possibly rewrite it in C, if there's time or inclination. This would allow
all the benefits of GNU cp combined with total compatibility.
