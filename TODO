rsnapshot TODO list:

for version 1.0.x
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Remove checks before calling print_* subroutines, just call them and let
  the routines decide whether to print or log

- Do --link-dest to the next highest interval if we're only keeping one
  interval. Double check that we would never delete hourly.0 or equiv.

- Do COMPREHENSIVE test before next release

- Keep track of whether we hit any non-fatal errors during the run, then
  report at the end whether the run was successful.

- Add and test logging feature

- Figure out a way to do transfers the other way: from clients to the server
  instead of just from the server to the clients. Of course it will have to
  be very secure. Ideally we could support chroot environments for the
  connecting clients.

- Update string manipulations and comparisons of paths to use File::Spec and
  File::Basename functions where possible. Double check they're fully
  compatible with Perl 5.004

for version 2.0.x
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Possibly rewrite it in C, if there's time or inclination. This would be a
  lot of work! However, it would allow all the benefits of GNU cp combined
  with total compatibility.
