rsnapshot TODO list:

for version 1.0.x
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Get package set up with the autoconf build system

- Update string manipulations of paths to use File::Spec functions where
  possible

- Add an file exclusion list feature

- Implement a generalized way to pass arbitrary args to rsync and ssh

- Support for SSH tunnelling (this may be handled by arbitrary args)

- Add support for connecting to an rsync daemon requiring authentication,
  either using the --password-file flag or RSYNC_PASSWORD env var

- Add support for arbitrary programs to handle certain types of connections;
  i.e. http_handler gets set to wget, to handle http downloads, which are
  then rsynced into main snapshot_root tree

for version 2.0.x
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Possibly rewrite it in C, if there's time or inclination. This would be a
  lot of work! However, it would allow all the benefits of GNU cp combined
  with total compatibility.
