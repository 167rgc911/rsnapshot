rsnapshot TODO list:

Come up with an elegant way to handle additional protocols,
probably using a web style prefix (i.e. http://path/to/http/server).
Make sure that if the file downloaded is the same as the one yesterday,
that it will link today's file to yesterdays. It seems unavoidable to
waste bandwidth with a non rsync system, but at least we can prevent
the wasting of disk space.

Decide on what to do about the slash issue with rsync/ssh. Currently
rsnapshot.conf only supports directories as sources (since it adds
a trailing slash to every entry). Will having the slash at the end
make this too confusing and error prone?
