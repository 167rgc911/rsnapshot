rsnapshot is a filesystem snapshot utility. It can take incremental
snapshots of local and remote filesystems for any number of machines.

UPGRADE NOTICE:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
rsnapshot has changed internally since 0.9.4. In the previous
version, almost all tasks were handled by external shell
commands (mkdir, mv, etc). In this version, almost all of these
external dependencies have been replaced with native Perl
implementations. This has a few noticable effects:

1) If you are upgrading from 0.9.4 or above, you should remove the
   following lines from your /etc/rsnapshot.conf file:
      
      cmd_mkdir	/bin/mkdir
      cmd_touch	/bin/touch
      cmd_mv	/bin/mv
      cmd_rm	/bin/rm
      
   If you fail to remove these lines, the program will not work.
    
2) rsnapshot is now compatible with a much wider range of systems.
   In addition to Linux, rsnapshot should now work with practically
   any UNIX variant out there.

3) When running rsnapshot on a system without GNU cp, special files
   will not be rotated in the snapshots properly. More specifically,
   FIFOs, sockets, block and character devices will not be supported.
   This is because there is no clean cross-platform way to accomplish
   this in Perl (and if you know how, please let me know). Since most
   snapshots are going to be of simple files, directories, and
   symlinks, this shouldn't pose a problem for the majority of users.
   If you desperately need this feature on a non-GNU system, simply
   get the GNU version of "cp" working, and specify the path to it
   in /etc/rsnapshot.conf. This has not been tested, but if it can
   properly run "cp -al" on your platform, you should be OK.

4) If you DO have GNU cp (on a Linux system, for example), be sure
   and enable it in /etc/rsnapshot.conf. If you do not wish to keep
   snapshots of FIFOs, device nodes, etc., simply keep the line
   commented out.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Once you have installed rsnapshot, you will need to configure it.
The default configuration file is /etc/rsnapshot.conf. If this
file does not exist, copy /etc/rsnapshot.conf.default over to
/etc/rsnapshot.conf and edit it to suit your tastes.

When /etc/rsnapshot.conf contains your chosen settings, the final
step is to setup a cron job to automate your backups. Here is a
quick example if you just can't wait:
	
	0 */4 * * *     /usr/local/bin/rsnapshot hourly
	50 23 * * *     /usr/local/bin/rsnapshot daily
	
In the previous example, there will be six "hourly" snapshots
taken each day (at 0,4,8,12,16, and 20 hours). There will also
be daily snapshots taken every night at 11:50PM. The number of
snapshots that are saved depends on the "interval" settings in
/etc/rsnapshot.conf.

For example:
	
	interval  hourly  6
	
Means that every time "rsnapshot hourly" is run, it will make a
new snapshot, rotate the old ones, and retain the most recent six
(hourly.0 - hourly.5).
