http://rsnapshot.sourceforge.net

rsnapshot is a filesystem snapshot utility. It can take incremental
snapshots of local and remote filesystems for any number of machines.

For installation instructions, read INSTALL

Once you have installed rsnapshot, you will need to configure it.
The default configuration file is /etc/rsnapshot.conf

When /etc/rsnapshot.conf contains your chosen settings, the final
step is to setup a cron job to automate your backups. Here is a
quick example if you just can't wait:
	
	0 */4 * * *     /usr/local/bin/rsnapshot hourly
	50 23 * * *     /usr/local/bin/rsnapshot daily
	
In the previous example, there will be six "hourly" snapshots
taken each day (at 0,4,8,12,16, and 20 hours). There will also
be daily snapshots taken every night at 11:50PM. The number of
snapshots that are saved depends on the "interval" settings in
/etc/rsnapshot.conf.

For example:
	
	interval  hourly  6
	
Means that every time "rsnaphsot hourly" is run, it will make a
new snapshot, rotate the old ones, and retain the most recent six
(hourly.0 - hourly.5).
