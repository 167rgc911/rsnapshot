UPGRADE NOTICE (Important)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  If you are upgrading from a 1.0.x version of rsnapshot, please be aware
  of the following differences:

    - The first backup interval must have a value of at least 2 if more than
      one backup interval is defined.

    - rsnapshot now returns 1 on errors (instead of -1). rsnapshot still
      returns 0 on success.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
rsnapshot is a filesystem snapshot utility based on rsync.

rsnapshot makes it easy to make periodic snapshots of local machines,
and remote machines over ssh. The code makes extensive use of hard links
whenever possible, to greatly reduce the disk space required.

It is written entirely in perl with no module dependencies, and has been
tested with versions 5.004 through 5.8.2.

This program should work on any reasonably modern UNIX compatible OS. It
has been tested successfully on the following operating systems:
 - Debian: 3.0 (woody), unstable
 - Redhat: 7.x, 8.0
 - SuSE: 9.0
 - Fedora Core 1
 - FreeBSD 4.9-STABLE
 - OpenBSD 3.3
 - Solaris 8
 - Mac OS X
 - IRIX 6.5


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMPATIBILITY NOTICE (Please read)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  If you have rsync version 2.5.7 or later, be sure and enable the link_dest
  parameter in the rsnapshot.conf file. This will allow you to handle any type
  of file on any operating system. To get the most out of rsnapshot, you need
  to use link_dest.
  
  If you do not have rsync 2.5.7 or newer, but you are running Linux, be sure
  and enable the cmd_cp parameter in rsnapshot.conf.
  
  These options are both off by default for maximum compatibility. However, if
  you enable one of them (preferably link_dest), you will be able to back up
  your entire system, not just most of it.
  
  When running rsnapshot on a system without either of these two options
  enabled, special files will not be rotated in the snapshots properly. More
  specifically, FIFOs, sockets, block and character devices will not be
  supported. This is because there is no clean cross-platform way to
  accomplish this in Perl (and if you know how, please let me know).
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once you have installed rsnapshot, you will need to configure it.
The default configuration file is /etc/rsnapshot.conf, although the exact path
may be different depending on how the program was installed. If this
file does not exist, copy /etc/rsnapshot.conf.default over to
/etc/rsnapshot.conf and edit it to suit your tastes. See the man page for
the full list of configuration options.

When /etc/rsnapshot.conf contains your chosen settings, do a quick sanity
check to make sure everything is ready to go:

    rsnapshot configtest

If this works, you can see essentially what will happen when you run it for
real by executing the following command (where interval is hourly, daily, etc):

    rsnapshot -t [interval]

Once you are happy with everything, the final step is to setup a cron job to
automate your backups. Here is a quick example which makes backups every four
hours, and daily backups for a week:
    
    0 */4 * * *     /usr/local/bin/rsnapshot hourly
    50 23 * * *     /usr/local/bin/rsnapshot daily
    
In the previous example, there will be six "hourly" snapshots
taken each day (at 0,4,8,12,16, and 20 hours). There will also
be daily snapshots taken every night at 11:50PM. The number of
snapshots that are saved depends on the "interval" settings in
/etc/rsnapshot.conf.

For example:
    
    interval    hourly    6
    
This means that every time "rsnapshot hourly" is run, it will make a
new snapshot, rotate the old ones, and retain the most recent six
(hourly.0 - hourly.5).

For the full documentation, type "man rsnapshot" once it is installed,
or visit http://www.rsnapshot.org/

If you plan on using the "backup_script" parameter in your backup scheme,
take a look at the utils/ directory in the source distribution for several
example scripts.
