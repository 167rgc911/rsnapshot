rsnapshot is a filesystem snapshot utility based on rsync.

rsnapshot makes it easy to make periodic snapshots of local machines,
and remote machines over ssh. The code makes extensive use of hard links
whenever possible, to greatly reduce the disk space required.

It is written entirely in perl with no module dependencies, and has been
tested with versions 5.004 through 5.8.1.

This program should work on any reasonably modern UNIX compatible OS. It
has been tested successfully on the following operating systems:
 - Debian: 3.0 (woody), unstable
 - Redhat: 7.x, 8.0
 - Solaris 8
 - Mac OS X
 - IRIX 6.5

GNU COMPATIBILITY NOTICE (Please read)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  If you have GNU cp on your system, be sure and enable it in
  /etc/rsnapshot.conf.
  
  If you are running a Linux system, or any other OS with the GNU version of
  the "cp" program installed, be sure you enable "cmd_cp" in the config file.
  "cmd_cp" is commented out by default so that rsnapshot will run out of the
  box on as many systems as possible. However, you will get extra benefits
  by using the GNU version of cp over the built-in substitute.
  
  When running rsnapshot on a system without GNU cp, special files will not
  be rotated in the snapshots properly. More specifically, FIFOs, sockets,
  block and character devices will not be supported. This is because there is
  no clean cross-platform way to accomplish this in Perl (and if you know
  how, please let me know). Since most snapshots are going to be of simple
  files, directories, and symlinks, this shouldn't pose a problem for the
  majority of users. If you desperately need this feature on a non-GNU
  system, simply get the GNU version of "cp" working, and specify the path to
  it in /etc/rsnapshot.conf. This has not been tested, but if it can properly
  run "cp -al" on your platform, you should be OK.
  
  If you do not have GNU cp installed, but would like to get the most out
  of rsnapshot, download the "coreutils" package from http://www.gnu.org/
  and then specify the path to your newly compiled version of cp in the
  rsnapshot config file. Your FIFO's and device nodes will thank you.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once you have installed rsnapshot, you will need to configure it.
The default configuration file is /etc/rsnapshot.conf. If this
file does not exist, copy /etc/rsnapshot.conf.default over to
/etc/rsnapshot.conf and edit it to suit your tastes.

When /etc/rsnapshot.conf contains your chosen settings, do a quick sanity
check to make sure everything is ready to go:

	rsnapshot configtest

If this works, you can see essentially what will happen when you run it for
real by executing the following command (where interval is hourly, daily, etc):

	rsnapshot -t [interval]

Once you are happy with everything, the final step is to setup a cron job to
automate your backups. Here is a quick example if you just can't wait:
	
	0 */4 * * *     /usr/local/bin/rsnapshot hourly
	50 23 * * *     /usr/local/bin/rsnapshot daily
	
In the previous example, there will be six "hourly" snapshots
taken each day (at 0,4,8,12,16, and 20 hours). There will also
be daily snapshots taken every night at 11:50PM. The number of
snapshots that are saved depends on the "interval" settings in
/etc/rsnapshot.conf.

For example:
	
	interval	hourly	6
	
This means that every time "rsnapshot hourly" is run, it will make a
new snapshot, rotate the old ones, and retain the most recent six
(hourly.0 - hourly.5).
